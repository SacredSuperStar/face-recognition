This is a TensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper 
"FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832

Inspiration
The code is heavly inspired by the OpenFace implementation at https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface

Under development
This project is currently very much under development (i will try to keep the issue tracker up-to-date with what is in the pipe).

Training data
The FaceScrub dataset (http://vintage.winklerbros.net/facescrub.html) has been used for training.

Pre-processing
To come...
