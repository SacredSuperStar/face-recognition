This is a TensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper 
"FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832

Inspiration: 
The code is heavly inspired by the OpenFace implementation at https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface

Training data: 
The FaceScrub dataset (http://vintage.winklerbros.net/facescrub.html) has been used for training.

Pre-processing: 
To come...

Pre-trained model:
A pretrained model in TensorFlow checkpoint format can be downloaded from Google Drive at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MzpY9kBtDVUFNFR21kZnYybkE/view?usp=sharing.
This model has been trained on the FaceScrub dataset for 35 epochs. 

Under development: 
This project is currently very much under development (i will try to keep the issue tracker up-to-date with what is in the pipe).
